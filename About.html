There is a sortbale.js file which allows me to sort the files in my html

<table><tr><td>This is my very rough schedule which i will scan usually at the middle of the month or the end of the month,if i do not lose the paper,
if i do lose it well you do not get to see it,I will post it in .jpeg and .pdf format so my own reference,this is not necessarily what i actually did.Its just for my reference.</td></tr></table>
        
<table><tr><td>Front Page is a tabular representation of my schedule for that week,with very messy annotations,according to week.</td></tr></table>
        
<table><tr><td>Back Page is a more detailed,i only write in days in which significant event happens,it does not contain everything.</td></tr></table>
        
<table><tr><td>Date Range is when this schedule is happening,be warned its very approximate and even inaccurate.</td></tr></table>
        
<table><tr><td>/others are all the other directories after 2019/0X/...</td></tr></table>
